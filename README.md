### Weather tracking

This app will track weather in any city you put in, and it saves your previous cities in a log you can go back and access later.
while you may have an ever expanding list of previous searches do be warry that only the last 5 searches will carry over on repeated visits to the site.

the weather will be displayed as an image, as well as the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the UV index for those who plan on being out in the sun for extended periods of time.

Uv index will be color coded dependednt on how extreme the index is.
